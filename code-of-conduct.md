# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, physical traits, or any other similar characteristics.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Collaborating with other community members
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized or inappropriate language or imagery, and sexual
  attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Discussing overly sensitive topics, including polarizing political views,
  violence, suicide, and rape
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by
[Benjamin Soyka](https://bsoyka.me). This includes, but is not limited to, my
website, my Discord servers, and my GitHub repositories. This Code of Conduct
also applies to individuals officially representing the community in public
spaces.

In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's
ability to participate within them.

This Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the community, including
staff.

## Enforcement

Instances of behaviors that violate this Code of Conduct may be reported by any
member of the community. Community members are encouraged to report these
situations, including situations they witness involving other community members.

You may report by emailing hello@bsoyka.me.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Community
leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any
incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
