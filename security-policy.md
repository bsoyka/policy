# Security Policy

This is the default security policy for all of my (Benjamin Soyka) GitHub
repositories.

This document explains how vulnerabilities affecting the security of one or more
of my repositories should be reported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I prefer responsible vulnerability disclosure. If you've found a vulnerability,
I would like to know so I can fix it before it is announced publicly.

**Do not open a GitHub issue for a found vulnerability.**

Send details to hello@bsoyka.me, including:

* a brief description of the vulnerability
* steps to exploit the vulnerability
* optionally the type of vulnerability and any related OWASP category

I will try to reply as soon as possible.

### Exploitation of Vulnerabilities

Please **do not try to exploit potential vulnerabilities yourself** if doing so
could affect a live instance of a project or if doing so could otherwise affect
other users of my projects.

Instead, I will look into the issue after receiving your report and will
complete any necessary testing myself.

# Code of Conduct

I have a code of conduct for contributors, which you can find here:
