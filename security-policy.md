# Security Policy

I welcome feedback from security researchers and the general public to help
improve my security. If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, privacy
issue, exposed data, or other security issues in any of my assets, I want to
hear from you. This policy outlines steps for reporting vulnerabilities to me,
what I expect, and what you can expect from me.

**Please do not open a GitHub issue for a found vulnerability.**

## Scope

This policy applies to the following digital assets:

- Any public GitHub repositories owned by me.

### Out of Scope

- Private GitHub repositories owned by me;
- Repositories owned by the
  [sunset-vacation](https://github.com/sunset-vacation) GitHub organization; and
- Assets or other equipment not owned by me.

Vulnerabilities discovered or suspected in out-of-scope systems should be
reported to the appropriate vendor or applicable authority.

## My Commitments

When working with me, according to this policy, you can expect me to:

- Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and validate
  your report;
- Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as it is
  processed;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner, within my
  operational contraints; and
- Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this
  policy.

## My Expectations

In participating in my vulnerability disclosure program in good faith, I ask
that you:

- Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other relevant
  agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other
  applicable terms, the terms of this policy will prevail;
- Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting my systems, destroying data,
  and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with me;
- Provide me a reasonable amount of time (at least 90 days from the initial
  report) to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities
  which are out-of-scope;
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of
  data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof
  of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter
  any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information
  (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary
  information;
- You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit
  permission from the account holder; and
- Do not engage in extortion.

## Official Channels

If enabled, please use GitHub's interface to report security vulnerabilities.
This can be done through the Security tab on some of my repositories by clicking
"Report a vulnerability".

Please provide all relevant information. The more details you provide, the
easier it will be for me to triage and fix the issue.

If this method is unavailable or not your preference, email hello@bsoyka.me with
the vulnerability details.

## Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research, according to this policy, I consider
this research conducted under this policy to be:

- Authorized concerning any applicable anti-hacking laws, and I will not
  initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good-faith
  violations of this policy;
- Authorized concerning any relevant anti-circumvention laws, and I will not
  bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service (TOS) and/or Acceptable Usage
  Policy (AUP) that would interfere with conducting security research, and I
  waive those restrictions on a limited basis; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good
  faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action
is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this
policy, I will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in
compliance with this policy.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research
is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our
Official Channels before going any further.

Note that the Safe Harbor applies only to legal claims under my control, and
that the policy does not bind independent third parties.

## Bug Bounty

Unfortunately, I do not offer bug bounties for security vulnerabilities.
However, I will happily provide recognition or recommendations for any
vulnerabilities you discover.
