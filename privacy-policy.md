# Privacy Policy

Thanks for entrusting me (Benjamin Soyka) with your privacy and personal
information. Holding on to your information is a serious responsiblity, and this
document defines how I will take care of it.

## Scope of This Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes the processing of personal information provided or
collected on my sites, whether on my digital properties or through other
third-party platforms.

I follow this privacy policy in accordance with applicable law in the places
where I operate. Terms used in this privacy policy are defined in the
[Definitions](#definitions) section.

Please keep in mind that when you provide information to me on a third-party
platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the
third-party platform. The information I collect is covered by this privacy
policy, and the information the third-party platform collects is subject to the
third-party platformâ€™s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the
third-party platform will not apply to my use of the information I have
collected.

Please keep in mind that my sites may contain links to other sites not owned or
controlled by me and I am not responsible for the privacy practices of those
sites. I encourage you to be aware when you leave my sites and to read the
privacy policies of other sites that may collect your personal information.

## Information I Collect

The personal information I collect can be divided into three categories:

- Information you provide directly to me
- Information I automatically collect from you
- Information I collect from third parties

### Information you provide directly to me

I collect the following personal information directly from you:

- Information sent to any of my email addresses as listed on my sites, which may
  include any information not listed here as provided to me

### Information I automatically collect from you

The following personal information is automatically collected from you when you
use my sites or open emails I send to you:

- Location information as associated with your IP address
- Activity and demographic information about your use of my sites, such as the
  content you view, how often you use my services, how you access my services,
  and your preferences
- Usage, viewing, technical, and device data when you visit my sites or open
  emails I send, including your browser or device type, unique device
  identifier, and IP address

### Information I collect from third parties

I collect the following information from third parties:

- Your full name and email address
- Your usernames on third-party platforms

## Information I Do Not Collect

I do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal information such as
payment details, personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political
opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or
biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data
concerning health, or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual
orientation.

I do not knowingly collect any information from children under the minimum age
limit, which is the age of 13 or the legal minimum age for providing consent for
data collection in your country, whichever is stricter.

If I learn or have reason to suspect that you are under the age of 13, I will
permanently remove your information from my systems.

## How I Use Your Information

I may use your personal information for the following purposes:

- I use your full name, email address, and applicable usernames on third-party
  platforms to identify you.
- I use your email address to communicate with you, if you've given me
  permission to do so.
- I use your full name, email address, and information you send to me via email
  to respond to requests for support or other questions.
- I use your usage data to identify how my sites are being used and to improve
  them.
- I may use your personal information if it is necessary for security purposes,
  such as investigating fraud and protecting my own or others' rights and
  property.
- I may use your User Personal Information to comply with my legal obligations,
  protect my intellectual property, and enforce my other applicable policies.

Your personal information will only be processed in the United States. I will
utilize reasonable security measures to protect your personal information.

I limit my use of your personal information to the purposes described above. If
I need to use your personal information for other purposes, I will only do so if
I have a good faith belief that doing so is reasonably necessary to achieve
those purposes. I will not use your personal information for any other purpose
without your consent.

You can learn what information I have, how I'm using it, and what permissions
you have given me by contacting me using the contact information provided in the
[Contacting Me](#contacting-me) section.

### My legal bases for processing information

To the extent that my processing of your personal information is subject to
certain international laws (including, but not limited to, the European Union's
General Data Protection Regulation), I am required to notify you about the legal
basis on which I process personal information.

I process personal information on the following legal bases:

### Consent

I rely on your consent to use your personal information under the following
circumstances: when you decide to participate in a research project, beta
program, or survey; and for marketing purposes, where applicable. All of this
personal information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access,
modify, and delete it at any time by [contacting me](#contacting-me). You may
withdraw your consent at any time.

### Legitimate interest

Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information I perform is
necessary for the purposes of my legitimate interest, for example, for legal
compliance purposes, security purposes, or to maintain ongoing confidentiality,
integrity, availability, and resilience of my sites and services.

### Requesting deletion

If you would like to request deletion of data I process on the basis of consent
or if you object to my processing of personal information, please use the
contact information provided in the [Contacting Me](#contacting-me) section.

## How I Share Information I Collect

I may share your personal information with third parties under one of the
following circumstances:

### Consent

I share your personal information, if you consent, after letting you know what
information will be shared, with whom, and why. You may direct me through your
actions on my sites to share your personal information.

### Service providers

I share personal information with a limited number of service providers who
process it on my behalf to provide or improve my services, and who have agreed
to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in this privacy policy by making
similar commitments. My service providers perform customer support ticketing,
marketing, security, and other similar services. While I process all personal
information in the United States, my service providers may process data outside
of the United States or the European Union.

#### List of service providers

The following is a list of service providers that process personal information
on my behalf as descibed above:

| Service provider | Description of processing                         | Location of processing |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Cloudflare       | Used to protect my sites and services             | United States          |
| Google Analytics | Used to analyze and improve my sites and services | United States          |
| Google Forms     | Used to collect information from my users         | United States          |
| Mailchimp        | Used to send emails to my users                   | United States          |
| Medium           | Used to share my articles and other content       | United States          |

### Security purposes

I may use your personal information for security purposes, such as to protect my
sites and services from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or modification.

### Legal disclosure

I strive for transparency in complying with legal process and legal obligations.
Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent
circumstances, I will make a reasonable effort to notify you of any legally
compelled or required disclosure of your information.

I may disclose personal information or other information I collect about you to
law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search
warrant, a similar government order, or when I believe in good faith that
disclosure is necessary to comply with my legal obligations, to protect our
property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

### Aggregate, non-personal information

I share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others
about how my users, collectively, use my sites. This information is used to
understand how my sites and services are being used and to improve them.

### Sale of your personal information

I **do not** and **will never** sell your personal information for monetary or
other consideration.

Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") requires
businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose
personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.
While CCPA only covers California residents, we voluntarily extend its core
rights for people to control their data to all of our users, not just those who
live in California.

## Use of Cookies

Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives
or mobile devices of visitors. I do not directly use cookies, but
[my third-party service providers](#list-of-service-providers) may use cookies
to collect information about you when you visit my sites or open emails I send
to you.

### Do Not Track

"Do Not Track" (DNT) is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you
do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information
about your online activity from third party tracking services.

Since I do not directly use cookies on my sites, I do not respond to DNT
requests. I cannot guarantee whether my third-party service providers will
respond to DNT requests when you use my sites or open emails I send to you.
